We have already scraped and stored the reddit comments from /r/CouriersofReddit, /r/PostMates, and /r/DoorDash. The data is now in a pickle file, and is of the following format:

-   PK: Primary Key - the reddit post ID
-   Title: Title of the post.
-   URL: link to the post.
-   Time: time of creation of the post.
-   Comments: the particular comment.
-   Comment\_Time: The time the comment was created.
-   Is\_Root\_Comment: Identifies if the comment is a root comment in the post submission.
-   Comment\_Parent: What which comment is the parent of this comment, has the comment ID in it.
-   Comment\_PK: the comment ID.

Import all the libraries that are needed - and read in the pickle into a data frame.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib
from wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS, ImageColorGenerator
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_pickle("/home/cantos/Dropbox/School/My Papers in Progress/Crowdsourced Delivery/flat-comment-df.pkl")
df=df.drop_duplicates()
```

We might need to save the file as a TSV for sharing with others. The TSV preserves the commas in the comments, and can also be ingested by Excel, R, and Tableau.

```python

#writefile = df.to_csv('/home/cantos/Dropbox/School/My Papers in Progress/Crowdsourced Delivery/flat-comment.tsv', sep='\t')
```


## Searching the corpus for keywords {#searching-the-corpus-for-keywords}

Ideally, we want to be able to create a smaller dataset for analysis from this big data set. We create an array with all the search terms we want to search for, and then assign the search result into another data frame. We can then print out how many posts and comments are present in the resulting dataset.

```python

search_terms = ['race', 'racism', 'racist', 'discriminate']
searchResult = df[df['Comments'].str.contains('|'.join(search_terms))] #creates the result dataframe.
print("The number of comments with search terms:", len(searchResult.index))
print("Total number of Posts", len(pd.unique(searchResult['PK'])))
```


### Top 10 posts in the dataset {#top-10-posts-in-the-dataset}

After we have created the dataset, it is evident from the last step that there are 1147 comments in 583 posts. This indicates that there might be some posts with very few comments, and some with many. Let's get a list of the top 10 posts with the most comments.

```python

topPosts = searchResult['Title'].value_counts()[:10].index.tolist()
for post in topPosts:
    print(post)
```


### Save the dataset {#save-the-dataset}

We might want to save this dataset as a pickle and a TSV if needed. Lets do that.

```python

writefile = searchResult.to_csv('~/Dropbox/School/My Papers in Progress/Crowdsourced Delivery/search-result-flat-comment.tsv', sep='\t')
## Write the file to pickle for other scripts to use.
searchResult.to_pickle("~/Dropbox/School/My Papers in Progress/Crowdsourced Delivery/search-result-flat-comment.pkl")
```


## Word Cloud: {#word-cloud}

I want to evaluate quickly what kind of themes are in the present in the data set. A word cloud usually works pretty well. I think because we are using the terms "race/ism/ist" in the search,  I would probably want to remove those words along with other stop words.

First thing we do is to put all the text in the comments into one variable, and look at how many words there are in total.

```python

text="".join(comment for comment in searchResult.Comments)
print ("There are {} words in the combination of all comments.".format(len(text)))
stopwords = set(STOPWORDS)
stopwords.update(["racist", "racism", "race", "people", "will","still"])
# Generate a word cloud image
wordcloud = WordCloud(stopwords=stopwords, background_color="white").generate(text)
```

Show the wordcloud, and save it to a file

```python

plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()

wordcloud.to_file("~/Dropbox/School/My Papers in Progress/Crowdsourced Delivery/wordcloud-search-comments.png")
```


## Sentiment Analysis {#sentiment-analysis}

Although there are multiple types of sentiment analysis engines out there, I do not want to use a custom training paradigm, or me having to train the model myself (trying to save some time and computer cycles). Moreover, there have been recent developments with sentiment analysis that I want to leverage. Enter VADER.


### VADER {#vader}

VADER stands for Valence Aware Dictionary sEntiment Reasoner, and is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is **specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media**. This makes it particularly useful for analysing reddit comments. VADER uses a combination of a sentiment lexicon - which is a list of lexical features (words) which are generally labelled according to their semantic orientation as either positive or negative, and also the polarity of the positive and negative sentiment.

VADER was developed using Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform to get most of their ratings, and can be considered the gold standard of sentiment lexicons.


### Advantages of VADER {#advantages-of-vader}

-   works exceedingly well for social media text, yet readily generalizes to other domains.
-   doesn't require any training data - its created using generalizable, valence based, human curated sentiment lexicon
-   fast : you can even use this with streaming data
-   It does not suffer from a speed-performance tradeoff


### Implementing VADER {#implementing-vader}

You can download vader via pip, using the following command
`pip3 install vaderSentiment`

We then want to create a new dataframe, I could do it in existing dataframe, but I am trying to not get it corrupted. Create the new DF with these additional columns `Comment_Neg,Comment_Neu, Comment_Pos, Comment_Comp`.

We can then take the sentiment of each comment in the dataframe, and add all the information back to the new data frame.

```python
from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

column_names = ["PK","Title", "URL", "Time", "Comment_PK", "Comments", "Comment_Time", "Comment_Score", "Is_Root_Comment","Comment_Parent", "Comment_Neg","Comment_Neu", "Comment_Pos", "Comment_Comp"]

postSentimentDF=pd.DataFrame(columns=column_names)

sia_obj = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()  #create a SentimentIntensityAnalyzer object
for index,comment in searchResult.iterrows():
    sentiment_dictionary = sia_obj.polarity_scores(comment["Comments"])
    postSentimentDF = postSentimentDF.append({'PK':comment['PK'], 'Title':comment['Title'], 'URL':comment['URL'], 'Time':comment['Time'], "Comments":comment['Comments'], "Comment_Time":comment['Comment_Time'], "Comment_Score":comment['Comment_Score'], "Is_Root_Comment":comment['Is_Root_Comment'], "Comment_Parent":comment['Comment_Parent'], 'Comment_PK':comment['Comment_PK'], 'Comment_Neg':sentiment_dictionary['neg'], 'Comment_Neu':sentiment_dictionary['neu'], 'Comment_Pos':sentiment_dictionary['pos'], 'Comment_Comp':sentiment_dictionary['compound']},ignore_index=True )
    #print(comment)

print(postSentimentDF.head())
```

Let us go ahead and save this file in pickle and TSV format.

```python
writefile = postSentimentDF.to_csv('~/Dropbox/School/My Papers in Progress/Crowdsourced Delivery/sentiment-search-result-flat-comment.tsv', sep='\t')
## Write the file to pickle for other scripts to use.
postSentimentDF.to_pickle("~/Dropbox/School/My Papers in Progress/Crowdsourced Delivery/sentiment-search-result-flat-comment.pkl")
```


## Topic Modeling of Posts/Comments {#topic-modeling-of-posts-comments}


## Data Cleaning {#data-cleaning}

Before we actually get started with topic modelling, we have to do a bit of data cleaning.

Let's start by importing the full dataset into a data frame for Topic Modeling.

```python
#Data Manipulation and Storage
import pandas as pd

# Text Cleaning
import string
import re
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

from tqdm import tqdm



df = pd.read_pickle("~/Dropbox/School/My Papers in Progress/Crowdsourced Delivery/flat-comment-df.pkl")
df=df.drop_duplicates()
```

Initiate the stopwords and wordnet lemmatizers. After that we iterate through the "Comments" convert all words to lower case, remove any links that might be present. After that we output the cleaned, tokenized and lemmitized comments into another data frame.

```python
wordnet_lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
stopwords_english = stopwords.words('english')

for index, comment in tqdm(df.iterrows()):
    text = comment['Comments']
    #make string lowercase
    text = text.lower()
    # remove links
    text = re.sub(r'^https?:\/\/.*[\r\n]*', '', text, flags=re.MULTILINE)

    #tokenize
    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text)

    #clean text
    clean_text = []
    for word in tokens:
        if (word not in stopwords_english and word not in string.punctuation):
            token = wordnet_lemmatizer.lemmatize(word)
            clean_text.append(token)

    #remove words of length 3 or smaller
    clean_text = [token for token in clean_text if len(token) > 2]
    #clean_text = " ".join(clean_text)
    comment["Comments"] =clean_text
TMdf= df.groupby(['PK', 'Title', 'URL'])['Comments'].apply(list).reset_index(name='total_comments_clean')
```

Finally, we save the df to a pickle so that we do not have to run through this whole process again.

```python
TMdf.to_pickle("~/Dropbox/School/My Papers in Progress/Crowdsourced Delivery/lemmatized-flat-comment-df.pkl")
```
